# Animal Shelter

### Adapted from the [Bits of Good bootcamp final project](https://www.notion.so/gtbitsofgood/Animal-Shelter-c3495607f1d24f369fed458b6d6d7d90)

In my first full stack project, I created a web app for an Animal Shelter which incorporates the frontend, backend server, and database implementation primarily using the MERN stack.

### My Tech Stack
Frontend: React, CSS (Bootstrap)
Backend: JavaScript (NodeJS, Express)
Database: MongoDB (and Mongoose)
Other: NPM
